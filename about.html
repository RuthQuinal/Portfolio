        <h6>Hello! My name is Ruth Quinal and I am 
an artist, filmmaker,writer, photographer,
designer and much more! I would doodle
a lot as a kid, make comics and eventually 
I got really into painting and filming. I use 
platforms such as Instagram and Youtube
to showcase my work and processes. 
	Iâ€™ve always had a passion for art and 
having the opportunity to share my art 
means everything to me. As art is a big
part in how I express myself and makes 
me who I am. I have dreams of directing 
my own movie someday, being featured in
an art gallery and creating a series of books
where I can continue to share stories.
	 You can contact me by email at 
ruthquinalart@gmail.com.

	<p>
	Art can be done by anyone and with anything. I started with 
standard printer paper and a wooden pencil. I have submitted
my pieces of art to many competitions and in my senior 
year of highschool my portfolio won 2nd place in the 
Tri-County Art Show in the Tri-County region in upstate 
New York. An achievement I am incredibly proud of.
